It's always a concern deciding who to entrust the care of a special pet. 
However, I no longer hold such concerns and am completely satisfied with High Heath. 
Harvey comes home settled, chilled and very well groomed. In fact he's so laid back he's not even that keen to get into the cat basket for the trip home (hope he doesn't prefer High Heath to being at home!!).
many thanks to Lyn and her team.
