Our lovely Russian Blue Stan always comes for his holidays to High Heath Cattery, and having previously tried a few others, we would not consider sending him anywhere else.  He is quite a shy gentle cat, who doesn't cope so well with strangers, but here he is clearly cared for very nicely indeed and always returns to us relaxed and contented.  The ladies who run this cattery are genuine animal lovers I think he is spoilt with fuss! Thank you for all your kind care of our Stan over the years!
