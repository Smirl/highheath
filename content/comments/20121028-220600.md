We used High Heath for the 1st time in July. Absolutely fantastic cattery, nothing is too much trouble for Lynn and the team. Clean, spacious, airy, a real home from home. Nikki and Nemi were a little unsure to start with when we took them, (as cats are ) but when we picked them up, i don't think they wanted to leave. We have booked them back in next year with the addition of their little sister Narla who i hope will equally have a lovely time there. I highly recommend High Heath to anyone who adores their cats.
