I left my 4.5-month-old kitten, Poppy, at High Heath Farm last week whilst we had a few days away. This was my first time away from her since we got her at 8 weeks old! 

Lyn and the rest of the staff couldn't have made the stay more positive if they tried.

Poppy was happy and well looked after and they kept me updated on how she was settled (very well!) 

I wouldn't hesitate to use High Heath Farm for Poppy in the future. 

Thank you!
