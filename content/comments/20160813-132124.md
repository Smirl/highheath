this is such a great place to leave your cats they are treated with love and care from all the staff there I had to leave my 2 cats 9 years ago in here for 12 weeks due to floods after that I knew I had found the right place to leave  my   little darlings   I had a persion cat and was worried about leaving her but in the end she just walked in  and loved being here , I can honestly  say any one can rest assure that there pets will be treated  with love and looked after 5* no one worries more than me and I have no worries about high heath cattery lyn and the staff are the nicest people you could meet from annette
