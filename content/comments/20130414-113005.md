Lucy and Ko ko stayed at High Heath Cattery on the 16th March for one week Lucy is a All Black half Siamese Ko ko is a Seal point Tabby Siamese.  The care the cats were given is second to none they came back from the cattery all chilled they stayed last year and they were also looked after really well.  The Chalets that they have are all heated they have quilts in there when we went away it was really cold but the comfort the cats have and warmth is wonderful.  All of the staff that look after the animals are all real animal lovers this must be by far one of the bests catteries i have come across i cant praise them enough.  Take your cats there and be sure of a warm welcome warm accomodation and plenty of cuddles and play.
