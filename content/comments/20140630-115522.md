I've never used a cattery before and was very nervous about leaving my 15 year old cat but i have to say the service, facilities and professionalism was fantastic, you put my mind at ease and I knew she was going to be looked after well, I cannot thank you all enough and I know from now on in I have found an excellent cattery and would recommend it to anyone, Mara was never the most sociable of cats but shes come back from her holiday with a personality transplant!

Thank you so much to everyone.

Chris &amp; Mara
