Hi All,
Just to say a big thank you for looking after Smudge once again while we went away for a few days.We know we can leave her with you and have peace of mind while we take a break..
She always looks so well groomed on her return and we know she loves staying with you.
You give so much care and fuss to her during her stay, that she seems reluctant to leave!
So once again many thanks to Lyn and all the staff at the five star cattery.
xx
