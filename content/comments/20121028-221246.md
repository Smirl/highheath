Have just checked out for the 3rd time from my holiday home known as 'High Heath'. My 'owner' tends to over worry on where I go, as I'm quite pampered (allegedly) but she needn't worry with High Heath - it really is like staying at the Ritz! Everyone is charming, kind &amp; considerate, especially when I flirt with the ladies (or even when I'm whinging!) &amp; it's almost a shame to go home (don't tell the boss!!). Looking forward to the next one! Thanks to you all xx
