High Heath Cattery is by far one of the best Catteries around the care that they show to the cats it is as each individual cat is there own they give constant love and cuddles from all of the Staff.  Lynn the lady who runs the  Cattery is a truly amazing person so kind and caring.  Unfortunately for us our house caught fire 3 weeks ago quite severe damage has been done.  Fortunately for KoKo Lucy and Tilly our 3 babies went to stay at High Heath Cattery were they are being spoiled rotten given lots of love and cuddles.  The state of the art enclosures are all heated got scratch posts litter trays toys galore and they are spotlessley clean.  Our one cat has had an operation on his leg and has to have medication this is not a problem each pen has a chart with all of the cats needs on so every member of staff knows what is what they also have a great selection of food and if a particular cat is on a special diet they are caterd for this Cattery really is 5 Star.  Because of the severity of the fire the cats shall probably be staying another 2 to 3 weeks but I have piece of mind that they are all happy and safe I commented to Lynn perhaps we should have booked ourselves inn !!!!!!!.
