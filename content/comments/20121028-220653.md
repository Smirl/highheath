Our cats (Chester, Izzy and latest addition, Alfie) have been going to High Heath for the past few years. It was the only cattery where we were made to feel that Lynn and the team really understood that the cats were part of our family and we felt assured they would be cared for during their stays. 
Each time we collect our cats they are as healthy as the day they were dropped off, and always reluctant to leave! - a great testament to the way they are looked after. Thanks
