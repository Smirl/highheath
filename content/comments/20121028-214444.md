My cats Fred and Barnie have been here on a number of occasions and was very pleased with the way they were looked after. I think its nice to be able to see where they are staying and that the pens are inside. I have been to a cattery before where when i have picked up my cats they seem very scared. Not at High Heath they never actually wanted to come home they were having so much fun. Thanks to everyone at the cattery as now feel i can go on my hols and my cats are in safe hands. xx
