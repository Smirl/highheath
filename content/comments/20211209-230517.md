They are all FABULOUS at High Heath Farm Cattery. I have been taking my cats to Lyn for many years and the care is second to none, BRILLIANT. When one of my cats Freya was 15 and had a severe stroke and was very, very poorly. Lyn went above and beyond for my Freya, nursing and caring for her but unfortunately she was too ill to survive, such a lovely cat, 
lovely nature. I would recommend Lyn and her colleagues 1000 times. You can rest assured that your cat will receive the best care in lovely surrounding and beautiful heated cages. FABULOUS!!
