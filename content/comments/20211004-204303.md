Lyn & all the ladies are fabulous, kind and caring people.  I have no doubt my cats are loved and looked after and it's the only place I trust.  We have been coming for a few years and I'm sure they come home more relaxed!  Our naughty little newbies Rex and Alex have already earnt a reputation there!  I'd recommend them without a doubt x
