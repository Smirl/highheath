My wife and i looked at two other catteries before we looked at High Heath.I can assure you that High Heath Cattery is by far the best that we looked at.The cats have plenty of room (much larger pens than other catteries) and the pens are absolutely spotless,with not a single odour,this was the case when we dropped off our cats and on collection.The lady who runs the cattery (lyn) cares about the cats (you can tell).We highly recommend this cattery,it made our holiday that much more relaxing,thank you very much Lyn.
