Our cats Molly and Abbie had a lovely time at this cattery. They were very well looked after, in very clean, safe and friendly cattery. So much so, they did not want to come home !!!! We would like to thank, everyone at High Heath, for making our cats stay, the best they have ever had !! we will return. Five star...
