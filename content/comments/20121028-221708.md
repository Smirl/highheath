This was our boys first visit with you and I was in no doubt they was not a better place for them to stay especially after all the time you spent with us showing us around the farm a few months ago. We have just returned home and collected our boys and they have definately had the 5 star cat treatment and looked calm and happy. I just wanted to thank Lyn and the team for their care of Diesel &amp; McQueen and for putting up with my phone calls and emails! For anyone who cares and worries about their cats like we do I couldnt recommend anywhere better for you fluffballs!
