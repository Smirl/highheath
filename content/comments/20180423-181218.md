Hello.   We are moving with our cat Pookey to Walmley, Sutton Coldfield at end of July.    Would it be possible to book a space for her from 2nd Sept to 10th Sept?

I will be able to let you have more details (new vet etc) as soon as I know, but in the meantime if a provisional booking was possible ?

Many thanks
