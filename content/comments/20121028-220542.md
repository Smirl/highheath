Absolutley brilliant cattery. My little Tiggy is my baby, i was really worried about leaving her for the first time, especially after some of the catterys i had visited. Lynn, Yvonne and the rest of the team are fantastic, Tiggy had a wonderful time and was just the same cat when i picked her up, ive now lost count of how many times Tiggy has revisited her friends at High Heath!! I recomend High Heath to any cat lover!! 
Thank you very much and see you again soon!!! Love Julie and Tiggy. XXXXX
