We have been using the Cattery for over 11 years and I cannot praise all the staff and facilities high enough. All of the people who work there are such animal lovers and we feel absolutely confident that our cat is well looked after. When we arrive to pick up our now elderly cat she is relaxed and happy, what more could we ask. 
Thanks so very much to everyone at High Heath. ðŸ˜»
