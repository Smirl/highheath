Hi Lynn - I'm sure you remember me? I came to stay Nov 2008 and I was very nervous as I am a little princess. I settled in very well and soon became the very vocal puss that my owners are used to. I greeted you every morning (feed me now) and am glad to say that when mommy and daddy go away this year I will be coming to stay with you.
Lots of licks and purrs - see you in December, Milly
