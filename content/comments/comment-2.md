My 3 cats, have been boarded multiple times over many years, mostly recently
Xmas 2018. This cattery is fantastic and the animals are well cared for. Pens
are roomy and warm, with comfty beds. All my 3 cats were boarded together and
there is more than enough room for all of them. Lyn and Yvonne and the staff are
very friendly and welcoming and I would never choose anywhere else. My fur baby
has a heart condition and needs medication daily to which the staff make sure
she gets, I never have to worry about her while we are away. Will be booking in
for 2019. Thank you
