Cannot thank Lyn and the staff enough for the love and care they showed our beloved Bengal cat Claude during his recent stay.
Claude did not want to leave and it was clear he had received lots of attention and fuss which he loves. 
Since being back home he has not showed any signs of being stressed at all.
I would not hesitate to recommend this lovely place or to entrust our beloved pet to their care again should the need arise.
many thanks.
Jacquie and Claude.  X x x
