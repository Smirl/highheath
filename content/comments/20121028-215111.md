We recently placed our two boy kittens with High Heath Farm Cattery for the first time, for a period of just over two weeks. It truly is a luxury cattery, and we were thrilled with how happy our boys were when we went to pick them up. They obviously had a fantastic time, and were made to feel right at home by Lynn, Yvonne and the rest of the team. The pens are a great size and it's obvious that they had a great time whilst there, and got plenty of strokes/cuddles while we were away. A truly excellent cattery, and one we will continue to use in future!
