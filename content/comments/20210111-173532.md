We have used High Heath many times and have no hesitation in recommending this cattery. The staff inspire confidence, the accommodation is of the highest quality. We have placed our pets at other facilities and you know, at the time of collection, if they have not been well treated. That simply does not apply to High Heath and our only concern when booking a holiday is that we will not be able to leave Peggy there. Absolutely 5 star
