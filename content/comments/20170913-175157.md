Hello

I am looking at options to put my four cats into a cattery whilst I move house and go on holiday for a week. I have 4 cats who are happy to be together - although can be split into 2 pairs. They do not require heated beds. 

I wonder if you have availability from 7th Octoberfor 2 weeks. Could you do me a discount maybe for multiple cats?

All the cats are up to date with vaccinations and have been neutered/spayed.  They are a friendly bunch! I want to minimise their stress levels whilst I move house and am away.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
