Jane you could always try phoning the chattery.  This place is a very well run and excellent cattery all cats are treated with love .  The chalets they stay in are warm spottlesley clean and everything that the Cat needs is there.  I have been going to this cattery for a few years now and in my opinion it's very best you shall find.  Lynn and her team are excellent our house caught fire 2 years ago plus we had a Siamese who had a very bad leg injury the care they gave our animals for3 months was wonderful they were our life savers for the cats and I don't know what we would have done without them.
