Thanks again Lyn and the team, we really appreciate the hard work you put into looking after Pepper as we know she can be a hand full. The cattery is always clean and comfortable for the cats, and they are fed quality food. All of the staff are very professional and always smiling. l like the the honest feed back I get about Pepper and her stay, it shows you have all taken time to get to know the cats. 
see you next year
Clare, Paul, Jessica and a big thank you from Pepper
