Excellent Cattery. The cats, I have 2, are well cared for. The staff are friendly and remember my cats each time. They were very good looking after Hamilton when he was wearing a collar for an injury sustained just before his 'holiday'. The whole place is clean, no smell, all cats seem quite happy. Highly recommend this 'all inclusive luxury hotel' for cats.
