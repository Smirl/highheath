hi I am 13 years old and wondering if you would let me come and do a saterday job. I love cats but I still don't mind doing the litter and scooping out the waste. I can also feed them and help the cats and kittens feel more at home. I will hopefully be phoning in soon and coming to see you in person to speak to you further.
thank you!
