This was Arthur's second time and he has had as good a time as the first! He had a difficult start in life as a stray and I am overprotective so leaving him for the first time was hard but he was looked after so well, I had no concerns at all when I brought him in. He is coming to stay at his " holiday cottage" again in a few weeks and I know he will love it. Thank you for taking care of him. It gives me such peace of mind to know he is cared for so well.
