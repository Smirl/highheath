5  ***** Review 
Theo stayed at High Heath Farm Cattery for a week at the beginning of September after it was recommended to us by a family friend. We were nervous as it was the first time he had stayed away from us but we could honestly not speak highly enough of the staff and care that was given to him. We didn’t have to worry about him and had regular updates of how he was settling in and pictures too.

We will definitely use their services going forward. 

Thank you soo much for looking after him!
