I picked up Mythos and Little Mix earlier today and both were snoozing in the sunlight . They seemed a bit miffed at having to be disturbed to go home ! Both as usual have returned in an excellent well groomed way and were obviously well fed. Cannot praise this well run, clean, airy , spacious cattery enough. See you later in the year
