Well this time he was at hiscountry holiday cottage for 2.5 weeks while we got married and went on honeymoon and I cannot thank you all enough for the care you show to all the cats in your care. He has come back a relaxed and happy cat and his fur is just so soft. We really are so grateful to you all for the amazing care you give. See you soon. P.S Arthur says a special meow!
