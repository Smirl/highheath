This was Enzo's 3rd holiday here.Thank you so much for the wonderful care that you provide. I have no worries sending Enzo here for his holidays. He loves it and is always happy. When speaking to staff they always show that they have got to know my boy. All the pens are very clean and roomy. Thank you again and we will see you again for his nxt holiday (still to book)
