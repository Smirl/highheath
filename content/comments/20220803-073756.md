We’ve been using High Heath Cattery for a few years now and the team who look after the cats are fantastic and I can’t praise them enough. Always a lovely warm friendly welcome, and are happy to give medication when required. I go away knowing that I don’t need to worry about the cats and I can enjoy my holiday because they are in safe hands. A big thank you to the team you do a brilliant job.
