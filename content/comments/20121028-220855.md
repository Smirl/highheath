We have been leaving our two cats at High Heath for the last three or so years now whenever we go on holiday. They absolutely love it, and are treated execptionally well by Lynn and Yvonne. Pens and surrounding areas are always spotless, and the cats are given as much (or as little) attention and play as they need. Highly recommended.
