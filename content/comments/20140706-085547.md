Dear All,

Thank you so much for the care and attention given to Smudge while she had another weeks holiday with you. 
As ever she looks so well it is obvious that the care she was given was second to none. Hope she didn't attack you too often this time!!!

She is looking forward to another week with you later this year.

Once again many thanks to all the staff at the five star cattery.

Maureen and Bob
