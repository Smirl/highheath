Bluebell &amp; Hector had their 2nd stay with you in June, and again they had a wonderful time.  In fact so much that it was hard getting them back in the carrier!  We are so happy leaving them in your care while we are away, and know that they will be very well looked after.
See you in September for the 3rd stay!
