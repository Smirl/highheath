Would like to say a big thank you for the care you gave to Milly &amp; Felix.  It was the first time I had to put them in a cattery and was worried about them.  But I had nothing to worry about as they were well looked after and didn't even want to come home.  Even when they wouldn't eat the cat food they eat at home, you found a cat food they would eat.  I would definately recommend this cattery.  It was clean, warm, friendly and the care they show your cats is excellent. Thank you once again
