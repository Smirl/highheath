Have just collected my cream persian Mythos from this lovely place. It was the first time he has been away from home and i was worried as he loves company, fuss and brushing.I need not have worried, from the minute you enter your first impression is one of people who care for cats first and foremost. The cattery is spotless and odour free. The penthouse accomodation is spacious and bright. When I collected him it was obvious that he had been brushed regularly and had eaten well. I shall have no hesitation i recommending High Heath to anyone and shall definatly be booking here again when the needs arise. Well done Lyn and Yvonne , the two lovely ladies who run it. Definatly worthy of 5 star rating.
