We placed our cats with High Heath Farm Cattery for the first time recently. We were absolutely delighted with how happy and relaxed our cats were on our return - they had clearly had a good time whilst we were away! The facilities are spottless and all who work at High Heath Farm are genuinely passionate about their animals. We've owned cats for many years and are pleased to have found such a great place - highly recommended!
