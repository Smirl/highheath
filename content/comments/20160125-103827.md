25/1/2016. We moved into the area early 2015 and have been using High Heath for the last  7 months. Lovely staff, nice sized pens...3 floors for the cats to use, floor, middle and top. My 2 cats always come back happy and content and I know that they have not been stressed or worked up while being at High Heath. I would definitely recommend this place to any cat owner who wants to go away and wants the reassurance that their feline family members are being cared for as if they were at home. I have one boisterous chatty boy and a shy timid girl and I don't worry about either of them while they are there.
