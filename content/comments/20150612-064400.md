Our beloved Dixie has just returned from her holidays here with Lyn and her team. It was Dixie's first stay in a cattery and we were worried about how she would cope as she is doted on at home. After viewing other catterys, we decided that this was the best one and that everyone there genuinely loves cats. Dixie was very well looked after and came away happy and settled back into home with no problems. She will definitely be going there for our next holidays and luckily I now know there will be no worries about leaving her as the care is excellent. A big thank you to Lyn and her team.
