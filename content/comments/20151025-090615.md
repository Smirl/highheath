I left my cat bennie for the first time and was really worried how he would cope without us as he is very timid and shy.I put quite a lot of time into researching the best place to leave him and I was not disappointed.The staff where lovely very friendly and you can tell that they genuinely love animals.The cattery itself is top notch very clean and hygienic.I was away for 2 weeks and the first week I emailed them to see how he was getting on and they replied straight away reassuring me that he was fine,I would definitely leave him there next time I go on holiday.Thanks for taking such good care of him :).
