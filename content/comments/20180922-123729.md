We left milo our Russian blue baby for the first time and he had never been in a cattery before, after looking around I chose to use this cattery on the reviews and we visited before and was highly impressed, Milo had a lovely time and they all loved him he was happy and very well looked after. I can't thank everyone enough for looking after my baby. I will be definitely using you again in the future 💙😘x🐱
