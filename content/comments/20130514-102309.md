Many thanks for all your care and kindness looking after my moms old cat Sophie ,my mom is 92 so Sophie came to High  Heath while she was in hospital, Sophie's health is declining with age ,Lyn took her to the vet during her stay because she was worried about her then rang me with the results , this was so much appreciated.
anyone worried about their pet. . . no need ! just pop off on holiday and leave all to  High Heath, Lyn and her team treat all in their care as their own they are just wonderful .* * * * * Five Stars for sure , thank you again for you care  x pearl
