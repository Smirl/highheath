Hi! We had to stay at High Heath cattery for several months last year cos our mum was poorly. We didn't want to go to a cattery but mum said we'd be happy with Lyn and it would be like holidays. Mum was right. It was BRILLIANT! We had the food we liked and got cuddles lots of times each day. Pansy played chasing her favourite ball over and over, while I got even more cuddles, and I even learned to use a catflap cos Lyn hooked it open for me when I was scared of it at first. We love being back at home, but hope to be back soon, cos we love our holiday camp and cuddles.
