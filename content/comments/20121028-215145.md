This is a bit late in posting. We went to the USA in November 2008 for 2 weeks
and following a bad experience with another cattery were very worried about our
princess. Lynn was fantastic and little Milly was just the same as the day we
dropped her off. I would recommend High Heath everytime for the love and
affection given to our prized moggies. Thanks Lynn xxx
